    <p class="f5 fw7">We’re coming up to our 2nd Birthday at CAST, and over the past two years we’ve learnt a lot from working directly with charities to support them to do amazing things with digital. Whether it is working with senior leaders to improve their understanding of digital on the Fellowship, creating incredible new digital products and services on our Fuse accelerator programme or speaking to charities who are just starting out on their digital journey, the message has been clear there has never been so much appetite in the sector to use tech and design to improve lives and respond to the needs of communities.</p>
    <p class="f5 fw7">But we want to learn more. In 2018, we are focussing much of our work on small charities: those with an annual income of £1m or less. We are currently designing new programmes, resources and events specifically based on the needs of smaller charities, but we want to make sure we get it right - and this is why we want to hear from you!</p>
    <p class="f5 fw7">In March and April we are opening up our phone lines to talk to you about your ambitions for digital, the challenges you face and most importantly what you think would help you achieve your vision. In return, we’ll support you with our knowledge, expertise and connections, and where appropriate we'll put you forward for our brand new digital accelerator programme for small charities starting in July 2018.</p>
    <p class="f5 fw7">Your insight will make a huge difference to our ability to support small charities on their digital journey - so please book a 30 minute call with us so we can chat!
