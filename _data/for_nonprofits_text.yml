  Our Digital Fellowship is a tailored action learning programme for nonprofit leaders. It teaches the key aspects of digital development, from paper prototyping to business modelling.

  Eight hands-on sessions led by industry experts culminate in a design workshop within each organisation, where we unpack a key challenge that digital might help address and support Fellows to disseminate their learnings to their teams.

      On the Fuse programme, Age UK spoke to staff, volunteers and older people to understand how technology could have a transformative impact in supporting older people to enjoy later life. After going up and down the country visiting people's homes, a new tool was developed to enable workers to have natural conversations with older people that covered key topics to ensure they help as much as possible.

      Age UK is currently piloting the new tool in four locations across the UK. After the pilot, the team plan to make changes based on feedback from users and then roll out to more locations.
