principles:
  - |-
      We are a networked organisation that draws in expertise as appropriate to each project or programme of work.
  - |-
      We are a learning organisation that continues to assess and refine our own approaches, sharing what we are learning and also building on the work of others.
  - |-
      We work **with** social sector organisations rather the more traditional agency or consultancy model that develops products **for** them.
transformation: Our core work focusses on transforming service delivery for nonprofits through the use of digital technology. We don't do fundraising, social media or traditional website design and build. A more traditional digital agency would be better placed to that that type of work.
supporters_blurb: Thanks to our supporters who fund our work. And a big shout out to our network of truster partner agencies and organisations across the Tech for Good community.
