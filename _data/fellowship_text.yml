headline: Our Digital Fellowship is a carefully constructed learning programme that teaches its fellows the key aspects of the digital development, from paper prototyping to business modelling.
what_is_it: |-
  Fuse is a 12 week programme where charities, alongside CAST’s team of digital experts, interrogate a problem space, generate ideas for solving a well identified problem within that space and then build a prototype digital service or product tot take to pilot.

  Our user-centred, test-driven ethos helps ensure a successful outcome: a well researched, user-centred solution to the identified problem.
how_does_it_work: |-
  A nominated individual from the charity is co-located with CAST’s team, away from their normal place of work, for four days for the first eight weeks of the programme.

  We introduce the tools and techniques of lean and agile digital product development, which are the mainstay of tech innovation. CAST has an ethos of “learn by doing” with full support from our own product lead and programme coordinator.

testimonial:
  text: I had been pretty confident that I had a good grasp of what our services needed, from my privileged position as part of the digital team at head office working with the charity’s services team. How wrong I was. I very quickly became aware that actually I knew very little about what our services — and most importantly our service users — really want and need from us.
