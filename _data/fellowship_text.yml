headline: Our Digital Fellowship is a carefully constructed learning programme that teaches its fellows the key aspects of the digital development, from paper prototyping to business modelling.
what_is_it: |-
  The CAST Digital Fellowship is a comprehensive learning programme for nonprofit leaders in the fundamentals of tech and digital innovation.

  It is a unique opportunity for senior staff to develop a better understanding and use of digital technology. It will support them to become leaders of their organisation's - and indeed the sector's - digital development.

  It also empowers their teams to built their digital capacity and put learnings directly into practise on a tangible digital project.
how_does_it_work: |-
  The Fellowship is underpinned by a clear focus on digital leadership and pathways to digital transformation.

  The programme takes the form of a progressive action learning set, where the Fellow develop by working with digital domain experts, designing digital products and using methodologies and tools the can be applied immediately in an organisation to improve service delivery, reduce costs and free up staff time.
what_youll_be_doing: |-
  There are four stages to the Digital Fellowship, the first two of which are mandatory and the second two optional but highly recommended.

  We have seen from our experience working with nonprofits that all four stages are necessary in order for senior staff to become fully-fledged sector digital leaders, with the confidence and skills to lead change internally and inspire it externally.

  stages:
    - title: Core learning programme
      text: |-
        Eight half-day workshops in London, led by a range of experts across three months.

        The sessions offer a very practical, hands-on approach to learning. They help Fellows apply new tools and processes to specific use cases in their organisations.
    - title: Design workshop
      text: |-
        This is an opportunity for Fellows to disseminate their learnings to their teams, and to engage other people in their organisation - fundraisers, project managers, marketing and PR officers or trustees - in the planning of a new digital product or service.

        Together they will identify and unpack a beneficiary or organisational need that might be supported with tech, and work with a team of developers to design a potential solution.
  outcomes:
    fellow:
      - An in-depth understanding of how digital technologies can best support their missions
      - A good grasp of the processes of digital innovation and design
      - A strong network of other charity leaders
    organisation:
      - Experience of the early stages of a digital design process
      - Knowledge of tools and techniques for user-led, test-driven development
optional:
  stages:
    - title: Design sprint
      text: |-
        Immediately following the design workshop is a five-day design sprint.

        The nonprofit team, led by their designated Product Owner, will take the requirements identified in the workshop and turn them into a set of features for a new digital product / service.

        They will work remotely with the development team to create a tangible, working prototype for the new service.
    - title: Digital project
      text: |-
        A follow-on digital project, designed to encourage more immediate in-depth application of the learnings.

        This will begin with a one-day feedback and integration session in the charity's offices, which allows the team to discuss any challenges or blockers encountered on the design sprint.

        Training for the Product Owner in conducting user interviews and usability testing of the prototype. This equips the team to gather actionable feedback and refine the product so that it better meets the needs of its intended users.

        A two-week build sprint with developers and/or CAST team.
  outcomes:
    fellow:
      - Support with building and implementing a digital strategy
      - Direct access to tech experts and supporters
