how_we_can_help: We take care to embed all our approaches and methods into the nonprofits we work with. We help them become responsive and resilient to ongoing social and technological change.
what_we_believe: We've discerned six things that have enabled the huge impact digital has made in other areas of our lives.
  They're the underlying conditions that allow us all to practise in a way that can
  bring massive change. Six tenets for tech for good.
we_work_with_funders: Trusts and foundations play a vital role in realising the potential
  of digital technology to achieve social impact. We work with them
  to build stronger tech for good programmes.
how_we_help_charities: We know technology can revolutionise how we address complex social
  problems. But we need to transform the nonprofit sector and enable it to put digital
